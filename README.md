LEARNING NODE

Node.js includes three modules

1.Local modules

2.Core modules

3.Third Party modules


#1 node_examples - This is created to demonstrate the local module handling of node. How we can export one file usage and import the 
                   functionalities of that exported file in another file.
                   Here, a small demonstration of callback and error handling is done. Taking out the area and perimeter of rectangle
                   using callbacks and error handling.
                   
#2 node-http - This is created to demonstrate the use of node core modules. The core modules used here is http, fs, url.
              Here, a static web server is created.
              
What we need here is node.js core modules-http,fs and url
(P.S- we also can do with path module)

1.First, just create a local folder with any name.

2.npm init -y(so that it can create package.json file and keep your work running with node)

3.Make index.js file and put some code in it(use of http,fs,url)

4.Make some files,like aboutme.html or anything.html.

5.npm start in terminal(if no error, server will be running).

6.Type in http://localhost:port/aboutme.html or anything.html in browser.

7.This will take us to the right page according to the file name we enter.

#3 node_express - This is created to demonstrate the node third party module with core module. The third party module used here is express     
                  and morgan. core module used here is http. 
                  Here, a static web server is created.

What we need here is node.js third party module-express,morgan and core module-http.

1.First, just create a local folder with any name.

2.npm init -y(so that it can create package.json file and keep your work running with node)

3.Make index.js file and put some code in it(use of express, morgan, http)

4.Make some files,like aboutme.html or anything.html.

5.npm start in terminal(if no error, server will be running).

6.Type in http://localhost:port/aboutme.html or anything.html in browser.

7.This will take us to the right page according to the file name we enter.

So easy it is, give it a try.
